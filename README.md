# Gmail-Reminder
This is a program made in python that serves to send reminders to the user by email.
The app_reminder.py file is the file responsible for interacting with the database, adding reminders, deleting them, etc.
The reminder.py file is the file that is responsible for viewing the existing reminders and sending the reminder emails, so it is recommended that you leave this file running all the time on the machine, otherwise the reminders will not be sent.
To use this program you must allow / enable in the email the use of less secure applications, at this link https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?rapt=AEjHL4PYheJdAyZEAw8modlAb95J0jTFQ20nbxfZLsdpsRCZYQIyTnbRQ0tbSRYOhtLmHBIRY
